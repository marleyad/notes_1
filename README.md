# 🧠 MIT Finance Lecture: Present Value, Asset Valuation & Government Bailouts (Fannie Mae & Freddie Mac)

---

## 📘 Section 1: Auction & the Power of Information

**Scenario:**  
Two items auctioned in class:
- **Smaller package (iPod)** sold for **$45**
- **Larger package (autographed hedge fund book)** sold for **$60**

**Key Insight:**
- **Size and lack of information** influenced valuation
- Demonstrates the **importance of information in pricing**

**Quote:**  
_"Anybody that tells you size doesn’t matter is not being realistic."_

## 📈 Section 2: Federal Takeover of Fannie Mae & Freddie Mac

**Context:**
- Treasury intervened to prevent collapse of **two GSEs** (Government Sponsored Enterprises)
- They bought mortgage loans to provide **secondary markets** for:
  - Housing
  - Student loans
  - Auto loans

**Problem:**
- **Subprime mortgage crisis** put pressure on lenders
- Defaults led to losses at Fannie & Freddie
- They could no longer meet obligations

**Action Taken:**
- **Government guaranteed all obligations**
- Took over both entities to prevent systemic collapse

**Quote:**  
_"We, the Treasury, will stand by all of your claims."_

## 💬 Section 3: Student Q&A Highlights

- **Q:** How will the government pay?
  - **A:** "The government owns the printing presses... you want dollars, we’ll give you dollars."
- **Q:** Who pays the cost?
  - **A:** Taxpayers — now or in the future.
- **Q:** What happens to shareholders?
  - **A:** Shareholder value dropped **90–95%**.

## 💡 Section 4: What Is an Asset?

**Formal Definition:**  
> _“An asset at time T is a sequence of current and future cash flows: CF_T, CF_{T+1}, CF_{T+2}, …”_

**Types of Assets:**
- Tangible: Buildings, Equipment
- Financial: Stocks, Bonds, Options
- Intangible: Patents, Trade Secrets, Reputation, Knowledge

**Example:**
- **Google’s algorithm** is an asset → It generates revenue → May be protected by **patents** or **trade secrets**

---

## 🧠 Section 5: Reframing Asset Valuation

**Key Concept:**
- Cash flows must be **converted to a common base** (like a currency)
- **Different dates = different “currencies”**
- Use **discount factors (exchange rates)** to normalize

**Analogy:**
> _“Adding $150 yen to £300 makes no sense — just like adding money today to money tomorrow without conversion.”_

---

## 📊 Section 6: Net Present Value (NPV)

**Definition:**
- Present value of all cash flows, using **today’s dollars** as the base currency

\[
NPV = CF_0 + \frac{CF_1}{1 + r} + \frac{CF_2}{(1 + r)^2} + ... + \frac{CF_T}{(1 + r)^T}
\]

**Where:**
- `r` is the **discount rate** or **opportunity cost of capital**
- Discount factors (1 / (1 + r)^T) are less than 1
- A dollar today > A dollar tomorrow

**Discounting with no uncertainty:**  
> "Even without uncertainty, discounting occurs due to **impatience** and **opportunity cost**."

---

## 📈 Section 7: Market as the Source of Exchange Rates

**Key Idea:**
- Discount rates come from **market transactions**
- Example: Auctioning off a $1 future cash flow for **$0.97 today** gives a discount factor of **0.97**

**Quote:**
> _“The market gives us the exchange rate — we just need to look at the price.”_

---

## 🧮 Section 8: Time Value and the Role of Timelines

**Best Practice:**
- Always **draw a timeline** for valuation problems
- Align cash flows to correct time periods to avoid errors

**Common Mistake:**
> _"9 out of 10 valuation errors happen because the timeline is misaligned."_

---

## 🔍 Section 9: Modeling Assumptions (Simplified for Now)

For lectures 2–12, we assume:
- Cash flows are known with **certainty**
- **Exchange rates (discount rates)** are known
- **No transaction frictions**

Later, we’ll reintroduce:
- **Uncertainty**
- **Market imperfections**
- **Inflation & risk**

---

## 🧾 Section 10: Example of Present Value Calculation

**Project:**  
- Cost today: $10 million  
- Year 1 inflow: $5 million → discount @ 0.90 = **$4.5M**  
- Year 2 inflow: $7 million → discount @ 0.80 = **$5.6M**  
- **NPV = $100,000**

**Decision:**
> _“Do you want $100,000?”_ → If yes, take the investment.

---

## 🔄 Section 11: Opportunity Cost of Capital

**Forward-looking growth:**
- $1 today grows to:  
  \[
  (1 + r)^T 	ext{ dollars in T years}
  \]

- Reverse (discount):  
  \[
  1 	ext{ dollar in year T} = \frac{1}{(1 + r)^T} 	ext{ today}
  \]

**Terminology for r:**
- Interest Rate  
- Growth Rate  
- Discount Rate  
- Opportunity Cost of Capital  
- User Cost (Keynes)

---

## 🏁 Section 12: Summary of Key Lessons

- Assets = sequences of **cash flows**
- Cash flows at different times are like **different currencies**
- NPV = method for converting them all to today's dollars
- Markets provide **discount factors** for valuation
- Future lectures will address:
  - Uncertainty
  - Inflation
  - Real-world frictions
  - Complex instruments

_You now have a conceptual foundation for valuing any asset with known cash flows in a simplified world. This framework will grow more complex — and more powerful — over the next few weeks._
